# Task 6 — Bring Your Own Ideas (Open Innovation)

> **Goal:** Prototype and explore your own sub-projects or extensions that align with the overall mission of repository-scale QC for proteomics.

This task is intentionally open-ended.
If you have a creative idea that contributes to improving data quality, visualization, integration, or standardization in proteomics, this is your space to build it.
You can work solo or team up with others across Task 1–5 to extend, combine, or reimagine parts of the project.

---

## Objectives

By the end of this task, you should have:
- [ ] A **prototype or concept** that contributes to the broader goal of automated, standardized QC for proteomics.
- [ ] A short **documentation page or demo** describing what your idea does and how it connects to the main project.
- [ ] Optionally, example data, figures, or code that others can build upon after the hackathon.

## Background

This BioHackathon project aims to make QC generation standardized, scalable, and FAIR across public datasets.
Core work revolves around:
- **pMultiQC** — multi-tool QC aggregation and mzQC export (Task 1 & 3)
- **PSI-MS QC metrics and ontology** (Task 2)
- **SDRF metadata integration** (Task 4)
- **ID-free QC modules** (Task 5)

But there's much more that can be built on top of this foundation — from visualization tools and machine learning approaches to repository integration or benchmarking frameworks.

## Example Project Ideas

These are just to inspire you — you can combine, adapt, or go beyond them.

### 1. Interactive QC Dashboard

- Build a simple **web app** or **Jupyter-based interface** for exploring `.mzQC` outputs.
- Use libraries like **Plotly Dash**, **Streamlit**, or **Bokeh**.
- Enable filtering by metric, instrument, or experiment (based on SDRF metadata).
- Prototype an idea for a **PRIDE-QC portal** or **repository-integrated viewer**.

### 2. Repository/API Integration

- Develop a small proof-of-concept linking mzQC results to repository APIs (e.g. PRIDE, MassIVE).
- Example: retrieve dataset metadata via REST API → match QC files → visualize summary statistics.
- Could demonstrate FAIR principles in action.

### 3. Benchmarking and Reproducibility

- Create or collect **benchmark datasets** to compare QC metric reproducibility across workflows.
- Analyze variability across instruments, labs, or reprocessed datasets.
- Propose standardized metrics or scoring systems for repository QC benchmarking.

### 4. Machine Learning on QC Metrics

- Use **existing QC data** (e.g., from Task 1 or Task 5) as training input for ML models.
- Explore anomaly detection, clustering, or prediction of data quality categories.
- Techniques could include PCA, isolation forest, or autoencoders on QC feature vectors.

### 5. mzQC Extensions or FAIR Enhancements

- Suggest new metadata fields or schema extensions for mzQC (e.g., integration with SDRF identifiers).
- Prototype conversions from mzQC → JSON-LD or RDF for semantic FAIR integration.
- Evaluate interoperability with other HUPO-PSI formats (e.g., mzTab-M, mzML, or ProForma).

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Define your idea clearly**
   - Write a 2–3 sentence summary of your goal and what it adds to the overall project.

2. **Create a working branch or folder**
   - Example:
     ```
     branches: feature/qc-dashboard
     docs/ideas/qc-dashboard.md
     ```
   - Keep all code, data, and documentation together for easy merging.

3. **Use existing outputs**
   - Leverage mzQC files from **Task 1**, tiered metrics from **Task 2**, or SDRF metadata from **Task 4**.
   - You don't need to start from scratch — reuse existing artifacts.

4. **Document as you go**
   - Add a short README or Jupyter notebook that explains what you did.
   - Include small example plots or screenshots if relevant.

5. **Coordinate with other teams**
   - Join daily stand-ups to share progress.
   - Ideas that bridge multiple areas (e.g., SDRF + visualization + ML) are especially welcome.

## Tips & Pointers

- **Start small** — it's fine if your prototype is minimal, as long as it's clear and reproducible.
- Use **open libraries** like Plotly, Altair, scikit-learn, or pandas — no installation hurdles.
- Document dependencies and how to run your code.
- Align with **FAIR and PSI standards** (use mzQC, PSI-MS CV, SDRF).
- Think about **reuse**: can others integrate or extend your idea easily after the hackathon?

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] A working prototype, concept demo, or clearly described proposal.
- [ ] Documented in Markdown under `/docs/tasks/` or `/docs/ideas/`.
- [ ] References or dependencies noted.
- [ ] (Optional) Example data or visual output provided.
- [ ] Pull request opened and reviewed.

## Inspiration

This is your chance to experiment, explore, and imagine where repository-scale QC could go next.
Whether it's data visualization, community engagement, or automation, **any contribution that helps make proteomics data more FAIR, interpretable, or reproducible is valuable.**
